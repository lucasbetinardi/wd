<h1>Lucas Betinardi Silva: Background and Ambitions</h1>

<p>
My name is Lucas Betinardi Silva and I'm a Junior in Architecture major. I'm from Brazil and I'm an Exchange student at Illinois Institute of Technology this semester. For me, design is everything.
</p>
<p>
I started my interest in technology when I discovered the Apple, Inc. The clearly accuracy and attention in even the small details introduced me to this technological world.
</p>
<p>
I chose Architecture because it's something that relates with I most enjoy: design. Today I know that I don't want to practice Architecture, but even though I learn in every class that I choose something about design that fascinates me.
</p>
<p>
Because of Apple that I started my interest in programming, too. I always wanted to be an iOS developer, but I never really could start thinking about because of my College. In Brazil at that time was really difficult to find something related to this subject, So I decided to continue my studies.
</p>
<p>
Then, I had the amazing opportunity to pursue one of my dreams: the study abroad. I won a scholarship that covered a three-semester study at the United States, where one of them would be to improve my English and the other two to study Architecture.
</p>
<p>
Studying Architecture at IIT I really could resume my dream to be in touch with technology in a way that I aways wanted. Now I'm learning Robotics and Web Design, which I always aimed to learn so I could be introduced to the programming world, if I can say that.
</p>
<p>
My ambitions for this course specifically are that I want to learn and experiment everything that I can related to technology and design; it's an one-life opportunity to study something that I couldn't even imagine to find in my University in Brazil, that is one of the best universities in my country. I want to learn how to design webpages so in that way I can deal with designing, branding and typography, focusing on the part that I wanted to study too.
